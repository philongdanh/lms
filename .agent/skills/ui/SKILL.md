# UI Development Skill

This skill defines the standards for frontend development.

## 1. Design Aesthetics

- **"WOW" Factor**: Designs should be premium, modern, and visually striking.
- **Glassmorphism**: Use translucent backgrounds and blurs to create depth.
- **Micro-animations**: Use subtle transitions (hover, focus, loading) to make
  the UI feel alive.
- **Typography**: Use modern sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter, Roboto). Avoid
  browser defaults.

## 2. Component Structure

- **Atomic Design**: Organize components by complexity (atoms, molecules,
  organisms).
- **Reusability**: Build components to be reused. Avoid hardcoding styles in
  page layouts.
- **Props**: Define clear interfaces for component props.

## 3. Technology Stack

- **HTML/CSS**: Vanilla CSS is preferred for maximum control unless Tailwind is
  requested.
- **Frameworks**: Next.js or Vite (React) for complex apps.
- **Icons**: Use consistent icon sets (e.g., Lucide, Heroicons).

## 4. Responsive Design

- **Mobile First**: Design for mobile screens first, then scale up.
- **Breakpoints**: define standard breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl).
- **Testing**: Verify usage on different screen sizes using browser developer
  tools.
